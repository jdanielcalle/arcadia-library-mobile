Arcadia Library is an Android application aimed at library management, designed to manage the complete cycle of users, books and loans through a CRUD system.

The application is developed in Java, providing stability and compatibility with previous versions of Android. It uses SQLite as an internal database to store and manage information.

The application follows the N-Tier architecture, which facilitates the separation of responsibilities and code maintenance.
